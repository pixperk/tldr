## Overview

`tldr` helps you quickly generate comprehensive README.md files for your projects by leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs). It analyzes your codebase, extracts relevant information, and uses a customizable prompt to create a well-structured README.md, saving you valuable time and effort.

**Problem:** Writing a good README is crucial for project adoption and understanding, but it can be a time-consuming and tedious task.

**Solution:** `tldr` automates the process by using LLMs to understand your code and generate a human-readable README.md.

**Target Audience:** Developers, software engineers, and open-source contributors who want to quickly generate README.md files for their projects.

**Use Cases:**

- Quickly create a README for a new project.
- Update an existing README with the latest changes.
- Generate READMEs for multiple projects in a consistent style.

**Key Technologies:**

- **Rust:** The core logic is written in Rust for performance and reliability.
- **Clap:** Used for command-line argument parsing.
- **Reqwest:** Used for making HTTP requests to LLM providers.
- **Serde:** Used for serializing and deserializing data.
- **Gemini & OpenAI:** Supports Google Gemini and OpenAI GPT models.

**Unique Value:**

- **Flexibility:** Supports multiple LLM providers and allows for custom prompts.
- **Streaming Mode:** Generates README sections incrementally for large projects.
- **Customizable:**  Tailor the README generation process with custom prompts and instructions.

## Features

- **README Generation:** Automatically generates a README.md file from your codebase.
- **LLM Provider Support:** Supports Google Gemini and OpenAI GPT models.
- **Custom Prompts:** Use custom prompts to tailor the README generation process.
- **Streaming Mode:** Generates README sections incrementally, useful for large projects.
- **Code Analysis:** Analyzes your codebase to extract relevant information.
- **CLI Interface:** Easy-to-use command-line interface.
- **Configuration:** Configurable through command-line arguments and environment variables.
- **Extensible:**  Designed to be extensible with support for additional LLM providers.
- **Fast Generation:** Optimized for speed and efficiency.

## Quick Start

This example shows how to generate a README using the Gemini provider.

1.  **Set your Gemini API key:**

    ```bash
    export GEMINI_API_KEY=<YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY>
    ```

2.  **Run the command:**

    ```bash
    tldr readme --provider gemini --api-key $GEMINI_API_KEY
    ```

This will generate a `README.md` file in the current directory.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

-   Rust toolchain (recommended version: >=1.70)

### Installing `tldr`

#### From Crates.io (Recommended)

```bash
cargo install tldr
```

#### From Source

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```

2.  Build and install the binary:

    ```bash
    cargo install --path .
    ```

### Verification

After installation, verify that `tldr` is installed correctly by running:

```bash
tldr --version
```

This should print the version number of `tldr`.
